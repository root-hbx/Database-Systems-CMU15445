## Course Info

This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems. 

Topics include data models (relational, document, key/value), storage models (n-ary, decomposition), query languages (SQL, stored procedures), storage architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving trees, hash tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging, checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed). 

Case studies on open-source and commercial database systems are used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs. 

The course is appropriate for students that are prepared to flex their strong systems programming skills.
